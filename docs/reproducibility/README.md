# Reproducibility Assets

Run `make reproducible-report` to regenerate the evaluation summary, Markdown/\LaTeX tables, and JSON bundles that back the README and paper tables. Generated files:

- `data/eval/unified_eval_summary.json`
- `docs/reproducibility/report.md`
- `docs/reproducibility/tables.tex`

The report links every metric to the raw artifacts (patches, verification logs, and metrics JSON) so reviewers can trace results end-to-end.
