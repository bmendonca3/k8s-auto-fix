    \n# This block is not actually functional configuration,\n# but serves to illustrate\
    \ the available configuration\n# options and document them in a way that is accessible\n\
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.\n#\n# These sample configuration\
    \ options may be copied out of\n# this example block and unindented to be in the\
    \ data block\n# to actually change the configuration.\n\n# The Revision ContainerConcurrency\
    \ field specifies the maximum number\n# of requests the Container can handle at\
    \ once. Container concurrency\n# target percentage is how much of that maximum\
    \ to use in a stable\n# state. E.g. if a Revision specifies ContainerConcurrency\
    \ of 10, then\n# the Autoscaler will try to maintain 7 concurrent connections\
    \ per pod\n# on average. A value of 70 is chosen because the Autoscaler panics\n\
    # when concurrency exceeds 2x the desired set point. So we will panic\n# before\
    \ we reach the limit.\n# Note: this limit will be applied to container concurency\
    \ set at every\n# level (ConfigMap, Revision Spec or Annotation).\n# For legacy\
    \ and backwards compatibility reasons, this value also accepts\n# fractional values\
    \ in (0, 1] interval (i.e. 0.7 \u21D2 70%).\n# Thus minimal percentage value must\
    \ be greater than 1.0, or it will be\n# treated as a fraction.\ncontainer-concurrency-target-percentage:\
    \ \"70\"\n\n# The container concurrency target default is what the Autoscaler\
    \ will\n# try to maintain when the Revision specifies unlimited concurrency.\n\

    \ the request path if the current spare capacity of the\n# service is less than\
    \ this setting.\n# If this setting is 0, then Activator will be in the request\
    \ path only\n# when the revision is scaled to 0.\n# If this setting is > 0 and\
    \ container-concurrency-target-percentage is\n# 100% or 1.0, then activator will\
    \ always be in the request path.\n# -1 denotes unlimited target-burst-capacity\
