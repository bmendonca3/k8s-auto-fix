# Data Directory Layout

The `data/` tree now mirrors the lifecycle of the pipeline. Two primary
subdirectories expose curated views of the canonical inputs and generated
outputs:

- `corpora/` – Symlinks to source material that ships with the repo (fixtures,
  manifests, policy definitions, schemas).
- `outputs/` – Symlinks to experiment artefacts generated by the detector →
  proposer → verifier → scheduler pipeline (batch runs, live-cluster replays,
  risk reports, ablations, etc.).

The legacy top-level directories (for example `data/manifests`,
`data/batch_runs`) remain the canonical source of truth. The curated views
under `corpora/` and `outputs/` are lightweight symlinks so existing scripts
keep working while new contributors can navigate the data by category.
When adding assets, place them in the canonical location and add a companion
symlink under the appropriate view if it helps discoverability.

└── <symlinks back to the directories above>
```

The optional `corpora/` and `outputs/` README files can provide further detail
for nested structures if needed. By keeping inputs and outputs distinct (while
preserving legacy paths), the repository stays organised without breaking the
automation described in the paper.
